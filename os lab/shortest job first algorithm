Aim: Write a C program to implement the various process scheduling mechanisms such as SJF scheduling.
Algorithm:
1: Start the process
2: Accept the number of processes in the ready Queue
3: For each process in the ready Q, assign the process id and accept the CPU burst time
4: Arrange the burst times of each process in ascending order(Shortest burst time process is assigned as '0' process)
5: Set the waiting of the first process as ‘0’ and its burst time as its turn around time
6: for each process in the Ready Q calculate
	a. Waiting time for process(n)= waiting time of process (n-1) + Burst time of process(n-1)
	b. Turnaround time for Process(n)= waiting time of Process(n)+ Burst time for process(n)
7: Calculate
	a. Average waiting time = Total waiting Time / Number of process
	b. Average Turnaround time = Total Turnaround Time / Number of process
8: Stop the process
